    Amount of computational resources used by an algorithm

  <p>
    Efficiency is often determined by counting the number of operations an algorithm performs.
  </p>
  <p>
    An algorithm's efficiency is often described by a function \(f(n)\) that outputs the number of operations for \(n\) amount of arguments. An algorithm with <i>polynomial efficiency</i> is described by a polynomial function (e.g. \(f(n)=n^2\)). Same goes for other efficiencies like exponential or factorial.
  </p>
  <p>Algorithms with polynomial efficiency or lower are run in <b>reasonable time</b>. Algorithms with exponential or factorial efficiencies or higher are run in <b>unreasonable time</b>.</p>
  <p>
    Different algorithms solving the same problem can have different efficiencies as some may have more operations.
