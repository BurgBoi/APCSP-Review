  <h1>3.13 Developing Procedures</h1>
  <p>Procedures help manage complexity through <b>procedural abstraction</b>, which reduces repeated code and increases code readability.</p>
  <h2>How does procedural abstraction manage complexity?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>It provides the ability to execute a procedure only knowing what it does but not how it works.</li>
    <li>It generalizes code using parameters. In other words, the same code can be run with different values for a specific result.</li>
    <li>It provides the ability to divide large problems into subproblems that each can be solved using an individual procedure. This is called <b>modularity</b>.</li>
  </ul>
