                Imagine you are shopping online for your favorite item. Hundreds of stores sell the same item, but all of them sell for different prices. You want to find the store that sells for the lowest price.
            </p>
            <p>
                Manually going through all the stores would take hours, so you create an algorithm that can quickly find the cheapest store.

                    <p>You would need to create \(n\) variables to contain the prices of \(n\) stores.</p>
                    <p>Each IF statement can eliminate one store from being possibly the cheapest. You can eliminate \(n - 1\) stores before having only 1 store left behind. Thus, you would need \(n - 1\) IF statements to find the cheapest store.</p>
                    <p>Adding the number of variables and IF statements together and simplifying, you would need \(2n - 1\) variables and IF statements.</p>

            <p>
                Not only can the number of variables and IF statements get out of control, but you would also need to recreate the algorithm for every specific number of stores!

                Clearly, this can get very unmanagable, so programmers created a structure called lists.

                A list is like a sequence of cubbyholes put in a straight line. Each cubbyhole is called an element and has a sticky-note containing a number attached to it, which is called its index. The first cubbyhole in this sequence has an index of 1, the second has an index of 2, the third has 3, and so on. This index is like the cubbyhole's address. Each cubbyhole can also store things like a stack of papers, which is called its value.
            </p>
            <p>
                This sequence of cubbyholes is also mutable. New cubbyholes can be added and others can be removed. Cubbyholes can also be inserted between other cubbyholes.

                A list is created in pseudocode using square brackets <span class="inline-code">[]</span>. Brackets without anything inside them create an empty list with no elements inside. Brackets with values inside them like <span class="inline-code">[value1, value2, value3]</span> create a list with values. <span class="inline-code">value1</span> is stored at index 1, <span class="inline-code">value2</span> is stored at index 2, and so on in this bracket notation.
            </p>
            <p>
                An element in a list can be retrieved by its index. <span class="inline-code">list[index]</span> is pseudocode for retrieving an element stored at <span class="inline-code">index</span>. In pseudocode, the first element of a list has index 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                An element's value can be replaced by another value. <span class="inline-code">list[index] ← value</span> is pseudocode for replacing the value stored in the element located at <span class="inline-code">index</span> with <span class="inline-code">value</span>.
            </p>
            <p>Let's get some practice with this before moving on to other ways to use lists.</p>

                        Only <span class="inline-code">price &lt; lowestPrice</span> will update the lowestPrice when a new low is found.

                    <p>
                        <span class="inline-code">price &gt; lowestPrice</span> will find the greatest number in storePrices, so that is not what we want.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="inline-code">price</span> stores an element in the list storePrices, not an element's index, so any solution with <span class="inline-code">storePrices[price]</span> is incorrect.

                Just by using a list instead of individual variables, the algorithm was reduced to a few lines of code from the possibly hundreds for a large number of stores.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not only did using a list reduce code length, but it also allowed the algorithm above to work with any number of stores. No matter how many prices <span class="inline-code">storePrices</span> contains, every price in the list is checked thanks to the FOR loop. Without lists, we would've had to recreate the above algorithm for any specific number of stores.
            </p>
            <p>
                More abstractly, the algorithm you just created above finds the minimum value in a list.

                But wait, the algorithm only outputs a price, not the index at which the price is stored! We need to know the price's index so that we know at which store we can find such a price.

                The following code shows an algorithm that searches a list for a value and stores that value's index in <span class="inline-code">targetIndex</span>. This is a type of linear search algorithm.

            <pre class="block-code">
list ← [value1, value2, value3, ...]
targetValue ← someValue
targetIndex ← -1
index ← 1
REPEAT UNTIL(index > LENGTH(list))

    IF(list[index] = targetValue)
    {
        targetIndex ← index

                        Even when the algorithm finds its target value, it keeps iterating through the rest of the list, which adds redundant computations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The only answer that can stop the REPEAT UNTIL loop when the target value is found is <span class="inline-code">index ← LENGTH(list)</span>, which sets <span class="inline-code">index</span> to the length of the list. When 1 is added to <span class="inline-code">index</span> after being set to the length of the list, the value stored in <span class="inline-code">index</span> is greater than the length of the list, so the loop stops.
