                Imagine you are shopping online for your favorite item. Hundreds of stores sell the same item, but all of them sell for different prices. You want to find the store that sells for the lowest price.
            </p>
            <p>
                Manually going through all the stores would take hours, so you want to create an algorithm that can quickly find the cheapest store.

            Pretend there are only 3 stores to choose from. You store each store's price in a variable.

store2 ← price2
store3 ← price3</pre>

                    <p>First, you can compare the prices of store1 and store2, adding 1 IF statement to the algorithm.</p>

                    <p>Whichever of those two stores is cheaper is the cheapest store, so you would need to write 2 IF statements.</p>

                <div class="explanation">
                    <p>You would need to create \(n\) variables to store the prices of \(n\) stores.</p>
                    <p>Each IF statement can eliminate 1 store from being possibly the cheapest. You can eliminate \(n - 1\) stores before having only 1 store left behind. Thus, you would need \(n - 1\) IF statements to find the cheapest store.</p>
                    <p>Adding the number of variables and IF statements together and simplifying, you would need \(2n - 1\) variables and IF statements.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="content-section">
            <p>
                As you just figured out, you would need \(2n - 1\) variables and IF statements to find the cheapest store out of \(n\) stores. If you had 100 stores, you would need 199 variables and IF statements!
            </p>
            <p>
                Not only can the number of variables and IF statements get out of control, but you would also need to update the algorithm every time the number of stores changes!
            </p>
            <p>
                Clearly, this can get very unmanagable, so programmers created a structure called lists.

            <fieldset>
                <legend>List Definition</legend>
                A series of ordered values each stored at a specific integer index
            </fieldset>
            <p>
                A list is kind of like a sequence of cubbyholes put in a straight line. Each cubbyhole is called an element and has a sticky-note containing a number attached to it, which is called its index. The first cubbyhole in this sequence has an index of 1, the second has an index of 2, the third has 3, and so on. This index is like the cubbyhole's address. Each cubbyhole can also store things like a stack of papers, which is called its value.
            </p>
            <p>
                This sequence of cubbyholes also is not immutable. New cubbyholes can be added and others can be removed. Cubbyholes can also be inserted between other cubbyholes.

        <div class="content-section">
            <p>
                A list is created in pseudocode using square brackets <span class="inline-code">[]</span>. Brackets without anything inside them create an empty list. Brackets with values inside them like <span class="inline-code">[value1, value2, value3]</span> create a list already containing values.
            </p>
            <p>
                An element in a list can be retrieved by its index. <span class="inline-code">list[index]</span> is pseudocode for retrieving an element stored at <span class="inline-code">index</span>. In pseudocode, the first element of a list has index 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                An element's value can be replaced by another value. <span class="inline-code">list[index] ← value</span> is pseudocode for replacing the value stored in the element located at <span class="inline-code">index</span> with <span class="inline-code">value</span>.
            </p>
            <p>Let's get some practice with this before moving on to other ways to use lists.</p>

                    <p>Since <span class="inline-code">list1[5]</span> retrieves the value 2, <span class="inline-code">list2[list1[5]]</span> is equivalent to <span class="inline-code">list2[2]</span>, which retrieves the value 0. <span class="inline-code">element</span> is assigned this value of 0.</p>
                    <p>Since <span class="inline-code">list1[2]</span> retrieves the value 4, <span class="inline-code">element + list1[2]</span> evaluates to 4. <span class="inline-code">element + 1</span> also evaluates to 1. Thus, <span class="inline-code">list1[element + 1] ← list2[element + list1[2]]</span> is equivalent to <span class="inline-code">list1[1] ← list2[4]</span>, which assigns the first index of list1 the value located at index 4 in list2.</p>
